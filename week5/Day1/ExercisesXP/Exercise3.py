###  # ðŸŒŸ Exercise 3 : Whoâ€™s The Song Producer?
##########################
# Instructions
# Define a class called Song, it will show the lyrics of a song.
# Its __init__() method should have two arguments: self and lyrics (a list).
# Inside your class create a method called sing_me_a_song that prints each element of lyrics on its own line.
# Create an object, for example:

# stairway= Song(["Thereâ€™s a lady who's sure","all that glitters is gold", "and sheâ€™s buying a stairway to heaven"])


# Then, call the sing_me_a_song method. The output should be:

# Thereâ€™s a lady who's sure
# all that glitters is gold
# and sheâ€™s buying a stairway to heaven

# class Song():
#     def __init__(self,lyrics):
#         self.lyrics = lyrics
#     def sing_me_a_song(self):
#         for song in self.lyrics:
#             print(song)

# stairway= Song(["Thereâ€™s a lady who's sure","all that glitters is gold", "and sheâ€™s buying a stairway to heaven"])

# stairway.sing_me_a_song()
